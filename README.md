# Moba-Builder
This is a rebuild / refactor of the same project with a different backend, the latest version of react, more security features, updated frontend etc. Welcome to the 2.0!

Welcome to the Moba Building website!
In this site you'll be able to login into your own account, then start creating your own Heros that would fit into any MOBA setting. 
Such as League of Legends, DOTA, or Heros of the Storm.

When creating Heroes, you're able to choose what kind of resources they can use, their hp, attack, and many other stats.

When creating abilities you're able to choose what kind of resources they need, cooldowns, charges, channeling times, and more.
You're even able to declare an ability as an Ultimate ability.

Mix and match to create truly unique combinations!
